# MovieAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Getting started

To use the app, it requires an api key for the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
Once you have generated one, replace the value of the apiKey property in `src/app/services/tmdb.service.ts` with it.

There are two custom scripts made available to get the app running, pick one to run depending on your situation/preference:

Run `npm run assignment` to install dependencies, build the app and serve it.

Run `npm run assignment:ng` to globally install Angular CLI version 17.3.5, then install dependencies, build the app and serve it.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
